# The Strategy Pattern

**"Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangable"**

Better than inheritance
+ Different instance types can implimenti their own version of the algorithm (behavior/method)
+ Behavior can be changed at runtime easily with a setter

**Interface** sets what will be used in the abstract class, and a behavior class will implement that interface, setting a specific method to it.
